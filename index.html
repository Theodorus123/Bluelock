<p > Meguru Bachira (蜂ばち楽ら 廻めぐる Bachira Meguru?) is a contender of Blue Lock who currently plays as a center forward for
     Spain's FC Barcha in the Neo Egoist League.

     but his goal later changes to becoming the best striker in the world when he overcame his childhood trauma.</p>

     <h1>Isagi Yoichi</h1>
 <p>Yoichi Isagi (潔いさぎ世よ一いち Isagi Yoichi?) is the main protagonist of the Blue Lock series.
    Isagi is a second-year high school student who played as a forward for the Ichinan High School football team. 
    When he arrived at the Blue Lock facility, he became a member of Team Z for the First Selection. Unlike his fellow competitors, who were handpicked by Anri Teieri after watching them play,
     Isagi was chosen personally by Jinpachi Ego himself after seeing him play. Isagi's main goal is to become the world's best striker.
    After the Blue Lock Eleven played against the Japan U-20, Isagi is ranked as one of the top players in Blue Lock and plays as a forward on Germany's Bastard München during the Neo Egoist League.
    After the Neo Egoist League, Isagi no longer cared about being the star or even to surpass genius players,
    all that mattered to him was winning the matches he played even if it meant using himself as a pawn to do so. Isagi is an ideal candidate for the type of striker Ego strives to create.</p>

    <h1>Rin Itoshi</h1>
    <p>Rin Itoshi (糸いと師し 凛りん Itoshi Rin?) is a contender of Blue Lock, who currently plays as a center forward for France's Paris X Gen in the Neo Egoist League.
        Rin is the younger brother of Sae Itoshi, who started playing football with him at a young age. 
        He has played as a forward on every team he was on and has always been regarded as one of the top players. 
        He is regarded as Blue Lock's best player until he is officially confirmed to be by Jinpachi Ego at the beginning of the Third Selection.
        Rin's main goal is to become the world's best striker. He used to be fixated on defeating his brother in football and in turn, 
        getting revenge for abandoning their shared dream, but after the Blue Lock Eleven played against the Japan U-20 he let go of his revenge and decided to change so that he may become the world's best striker, 
        defeating anybody in his path. Rin is an ideal candidate for the type of striker Ego strives to create.</p>

<h1> Sae Itoshi</h1>
<p>Sae Itoshi (糸いと師し 冴さえ Itoshi Sae?) is a prodigy football player, who is known as the best player in Japan. 
    Sae is also a member of the New Generation World XI, as well as the Re Al youth team. He is the older brother of Rin Itoshi.
    Sae's main goal before the start of the series was to become the best striker in the world, and in turn, 
    the best player in the world, but after leaving Japan and experiencing the professional league in Spain, 
    he changed his dream to becoming the best midfielder in the world after he realized how truly weak Japanese football is.
    At the start of the series, he is in Japan only to renew his passport but after hearing about the Blue Lock, 
    he decides to stay. He later joins the Japan U-20 to face off against the Blue Lock Eleven in the Japan U-20 match. 
    After the Japan U-20 match concluded, his current status and whereabouts are unknown.</p>

    <h1>Michael Kaiser</h1>
    <p> Michael Kaiser (ミヒャエル・カイザー Mihyaeru Kaizā?) is a prodigy U-20 forward from Germany

<h1>Ryusei Shidou</h1>
<p> Ryusei Shido (士し道どう 龍りゅう聖せい Shidō Ryūsei?) is a contender of the Blue Lock, who currently plays as a center forward for France's Paris X Gen.
    Shido, unlike most forwards, has no concrete dream of becoming the world's best striker. He instead seeks to enjoy life to the fullest by playing football.
    
    Out of the original 300 forwards chosen to be a part of the Blue Lock Project, Shido is an ideal candidate for the type of striker Ego strives to create. 
    After the match against the Japan U-20 team, Shido ranked as one of the top players in Blue Lock.</p>
